Here's a 2-sentence image generation prompt capturing the core theme and mood:

A futuristic laboratory space bathed in cool blue quantum light, where holographic matrices and glowing error correction patterns float ethereally between sleek quantum computing terminals, with crystalline structures casting prismatic reflections across polished surfaces. The scene is rendered in a high-tech minimalist style with a color palette of deep blues, bright teals, and pristine whites, featuring subtle particle effects and data visualization elements that suggest quantum mechanics at work.
