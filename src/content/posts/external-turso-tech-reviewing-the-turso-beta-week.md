title: "Reviewing the Turso Beta week"
description: 'The Age of Agents will impose very different demands on data than what we had before. In addition to data lakes and data warehouses, we will need a collection of databoxes: small, self-contained per-agent storage to support the explosion in the number of agents that is inevitably coming.

SQLite has the right shape for this, but it lacks key capabilities that modern agents expect. Turso is a full rewrite of SQLite. It has the goal of bridging those capabilities, while keeping full API and file compatibility.

It is now beta.'
