title: 'Sourcetable launches AI Superagents'
description: "Today, we launch another world's first: Sourcetable can now connect to any database, API, MCP server, or 3rd party application on the Internet, all using natural language and AI. We call this feature Superagents, because they are AI systems that think, plan and orchestrate other AI tools and agents to."
