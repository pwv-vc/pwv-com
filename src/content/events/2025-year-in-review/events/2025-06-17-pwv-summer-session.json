  "description": "Hosted by Jennifer Tacheff, David Price & David Thyresson. Connect. Contribute. Kick back (virtually). Join us for a relaxed Summer Meetup with fellow founders in the PWV portfolio, as well as General Partners, Tom Preston-Werner, DT, and David Price. Why come? Meet other incredible founders across the PWV community. Shape what we're building for you—from our Founder Directory to future programming (we want your input!). Share what you're building or need help with in small, casual breakouts. No demos or decks this time—just good people, conversations, and meaningful connections. Hear about our new Fund's First Close! Whether you're heads-down or raising a round, this is an opportunity to step back, connect with people who get it, and help co-create what's next. Expect special guests to come through as always.",
