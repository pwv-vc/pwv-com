This year's program brings together a dynamic cohort of startups solving some of the industry's most critical challenges across construction, design, real estate, and infrastructure. The afternoon will kick off with a keynote from Jeevan Kalanithi, founder and CEO of OpenSpace, who will share insights on scaling innovation in the built world. Following the keynote, the BOOST 6 companies will take the stage to pitch their cutting-edge solutions to an audience of industry leaders, investors, and potential customers. Following the pitches, dive into our startup showcase to connect with founders, explore hands-on demos, and engage with leaders shaping the future of the industry, then cap off the evening at our BOOST after-party, sponsored by Marsh McLennan and Baker Tilly! Don't miss this opportunity to experience the future of the built environment firsthand.",
