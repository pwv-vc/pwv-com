  "description": "Region: Earth event in London co-hosted by Cloudflare and Prisma, bringing together developers to explore modern platforms for fast, secure, and scalable applications. Peter Pistorius, CEO of Redwood, delivered 'Back to the Future: Server-Side'—making the case for a return to fullstack thinking with serverless runtimes, edge databases, and frameworks that feel good to use. His talk explored how Prisma, Cloudflare, and Redwood are rebuilding the dream: a world where one person can ship something meaningful, fast, and their own—without a maze of dashboards and vendor lock-in."
