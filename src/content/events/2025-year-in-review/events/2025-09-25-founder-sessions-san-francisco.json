  "description": "Hosted by Jennifer Tacheff, David Price & David Thyresson. On September 25th, join us at The Light House in San Francisco for an evening with one of the best communities in venture and startups: our PWV Founders. We're digging into fundraising and what really matters in building and backing companies. The night kicks off with a conversation on where capital is heading and how the landscape is shifting for founders, featuring leading investors like Topher Conway (Managing Partner of SV Angel), Mary D'Onofrio, (Partner at Crosslink Capital, fmr Bessemer Venture Partners), and David Price (PWV General Partner). Next up, we're hosting a special Founder Sessions panel with Scott Johnston (ex-CEO of Docker), Johannes Landgraf, (Co-Founder & CEO of Ona, formerly Gitpod), and Tom Preston-Werner (Co-Founder of GitHub, PWV General Partner). To round out the evening, expect delectable libations and a family-style dinner fueling dynamic conversations, fresh perspectives, and the kind of connections that make incredible things happen."
