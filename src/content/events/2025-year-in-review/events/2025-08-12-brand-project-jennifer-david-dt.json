  "description": "PWV got a fresh new look! New website, new logo, and yes—lots of green. The green is a nod to those old green CRT monitors from our early computer days as kids, learning to code for the first time. The rebrand brings a cleaner, more modern vibe that better represents how we support founders and build community."
