Hiring is one of the most critical and challenging parts of building a company, especially in the early stages. In this hands-on workshop, Martin will walk founders through the full lifecycle of hiring: from sourcing and evaluating candidates to closing and retaining top talent. As the former Head of Engineering at Fractal Software, Martin built and ran the CTO vetting process, interviewing and assessing hundreds of founders and helping launch 145+ vertical SaaS startups in just over two years, each backed with $1M in pre-seed capital. Before that, he held engineering roles at Google, Amazon, Lyft, and Tudor, as well as several startups. Martin brings a rare blend of experience, having built technical teams from zero to scale across both startup and enterprise environments. Expect tactical insights, proven frameworks, and candid lessons learned from hundreds of hiring processes. Why Attend: Learn how to build and scale your team the right way, from sourcing to close. Get proven frameworks from someone who's vetted hundreds of founders, CTOs and engineers. Connect with other founders in the PWV ecosystem and hear directly from the PWV leadership team."
