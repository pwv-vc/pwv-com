  "description": "Hosted by Jennifer Tacheff, David Price & David Thyresson. We're bringing together a small group of prospective LPs, family offices, and fund-of-funds (FoFs) for a private, invitation-only gathering with Tom Preston-Werner, David Thyresson (DT), and David Price before PWV Fund I's first close on Friday, April 18th. This is a final chance to spend time with the PWV team in an informal, high-value setting, ask any final questions about the fund and our investment approach, connect with other investors who are also considering participation, and align on next steps if you've been reviewing the data room. Agenda: 4:30 – 5:30 PM | Drinks, Conversations & Connections - Kick off the evening over great drinks, light bites, and conversations with the PWV team and fellow investors. 5:30 – 6:30 PM | The Inside Track on PWV Fund I - A deeper dive into PWV Fund I, our investment strategy, and what's ahead. We're on track for first close, and this will be one of the final opportunities to engage in person before allocations are set.",
