We're going to discuss the current state of Venture Capital investing + fundraising in the context of the (almost certain) \"AI Bubble\". We don't have all the answers, but we'll make progress by diving into questions as a group: What's going on? What is the felt experience? (ground truth). Should I care? (risks). Should I do anything differently? (strategy + tactics). Before the meetup, we'll start the conversation in the #pwv-founders channel on Slack. And we'll be adding some resources to read and listen to. It's going to be fun + important! We hope you'll join us. About PWV Monthly Virtual Meetups: Hosted by General Partners Tom, DT, and David, this is a monthly opportunity for all founders in the PWV Portfolio Company ecosystem.
