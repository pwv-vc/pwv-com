  "description": "PWV engages in the AI community through education-focused conversations, General partner DT, as an Andover alum, learns about his alma mater's skills-first teaching approach to AI in education. Examples included using AI as simulation for oral exam practice, the 'seven-prompt essay' grading conversation logs rather than AI output, and students creating fake historical documents to strengthen critical thinking. The framework emphasizes AI as a supportive tool—not a replacement for human judgment—preparing students to think clearly in an AI-augmented world.",
