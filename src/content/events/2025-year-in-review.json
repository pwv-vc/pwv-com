Next up, we're hosting a special Founder Sessions panel with Scott Johnston (ex-CEO of Docker), Johannes Landgraf, (Co-Founder & CEO of Ona, formerly Gitpod), and Tom Preston-Werner (Co-Founder of GitHub, PWV General Partner). To round out the evening, expect delectable libations and a family-style dinner fueling dynamic conversations, fresh perspectives, and the kind of connections that make incredible things happen."

We're going to discuss the current state of Venture Capital investing + fundraising in the context of the (almost certain) \"AI Bubble\". We don't have all the answers, but we'll make progress by diving into questions as a group: What's going on? What is the felt experience? (ground truth). Should I care? (risks). Should I do anything differently? (strategy + tactics). Before the meetup, we'll start the conversation in the #pwv-founders channel on Slack. And we'll be adding some resources to read and listen to. It's going to be fun + important! We hope you'll join us. About PWV Monthly Virtual Meetups: Hosted by General Partners Tom, DT, and David, this is a monthly opportunity for all founders in the PWV Portfolio Company ecosystem. Why Attend: Meet and learn from other founders in our portfolio (read: the best community!). Hear from the PWV team who have built some of the biggest movements, products, and companies across industries. Plus, you never know who may swing by as a special guest."

In this hands-on workshop, Martin will walk founders through the full lifecycle of hiring: from sourcing and evaluating candidates to closing and retaining top talent. As the former Head of Engineering at Fractal Software, Martin built and ran the CTO vetting process, interviewing and assessing hundreds of founders and helping launch 145+ vertical SaaS startups in just over two years, each backed with $1M in pre-seed capital. Before that, he held engineering roles at Google, Amazon, Lyft, and Tudor, as well as several startups. Martin brings a rare blend of experience, having built technical teams from zero to scale across both startup and enterprise environments. Expect tactical insights, proven frameworks, and candid lessons learned from hundreds of hiring processes. Why Attend: Learn how to build and scale your team the right way, from sourcing to close. Get proven frameworks from someone who's vetted hundreds of founders, CTOs and engineers. Connect with other founders in the PWV ecosystem and hear directly from the PWV leadership team."
