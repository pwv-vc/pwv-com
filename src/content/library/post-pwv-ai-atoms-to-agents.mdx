AI needs energy. AI needs quality data. AI needs efficient models. AI needs trust and guardrails. AI needs to be scalable. AI needs tools for developers to build with.

It's not just the end product that we should invest in, but the technology and infrastructure that makes it possible.

At PWV, we're investing in companies building AI-powered products and services like Val Town, Unriddle, Parley, Purplefish, Mineflow, Myriad and more.

But we're also investing in the tools and the technology and infrastructure that makes it possible.

Cursor, Langbase, and fal provide developer tools to build AI applications. Not Diamond automatically determines which model is best-suited to respond.

And we're investing in companies that are building the infrastructure to support the next generation of AI applications.

QuantPi and Alinia focus on building trust and transparency in AI.

Liquid and Poolside are building new models that are more efficient and effective than the ones currently on the market.

But, we also need the energy to power the data centers AI will use. So, we've invested in Aalo.

By taking a comprehensive approach to investing in AI, we can ensure that the next generation of AI applications and startups have what they need to succeed.
