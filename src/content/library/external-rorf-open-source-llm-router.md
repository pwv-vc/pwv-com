title: "RoRF – Open Source LLM Router"
description: "RoRF (Routing on Random Forests) is an open-source LLM router that efficiently directs prompts between pairs of large language models using a Random Forest Classifier trained on evaluation data and prompt embeddings. This lightweight yet powerful tool includes six pre-trained routers for various model pairs including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 variants, offering a more cost-effective solution compared to using individual models while outperforming other open-source router architectures."
