title: 'A letter from Ralf and Jan'
description: 'I grew up in a family of lawyers, surrounded by the realities of law and regulation. From early on, I saw how much time and energy went into legal and regulatory compliance work. How manual and antiquated the work was, and how it constrained innovation. I understood both the magnitude of the challenge and the size of the opportunity. But I also knew why automation wasn’t yet possible. The technology simply wasn’t ready.'
