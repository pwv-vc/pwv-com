Tom Preston-Werner is a visionary entrepreneur, technologist, and investor who helped shape the open-source era and modern day software, overall.

As the co-founder and former CEO of GitHub, Tom reinvented how the world builds tools and companies, turning collaboration itself into the cornerstone of global innovation.

Tom also created foundational technologies including Jekyll, Semantic Versioning (SemVer), and TOML, tools that continue to underpin modern software development globally.

His open-source contributions have influenced millions of developers and remain integral to the world's software infrastructure, cementing his reputation as a leader in tooling innovation. His philosophy of open collaboration extends beyond code, to capital, community, and innovation.

Today, Tom leads PWV (Preston-Werner Ventures), the venture firm he founded after more than a decade of angel investing in over 175 startups, including early investments in **Stripe**, **Cursor**, **Netlify**, **Snyk**, **Supabase**, **PlanetScale**, and **Retool**.

PWV is now raising a $100M fund to lead pre-seed and seed rounds in the next generation of software- and AI-driven companies.

Tom and his partners, [David Price](/team/david-price) and [David Thyresson (DT)](/team/david-thyresson), have built PWV into the venture firm they wish they'd had early in their own startup journeys:

**Founder-Focused**: Supporting founders with hands-on guidance rooted in real startup experience.

**Community-Oriented**: Connecting over 150 portfolio founders through shared knowledge, mentorship, and events.

**Networked**: Leveraging deep relationships with world-class investors and operators to accelerate growth and follow-on funding.

In addition to his work at PWV, Tom serves as CEO of 180 Studios, leading its expansion into next-generation creative and production software built on version control and automation systems for the global creative industry.

A signatory of The Giving Pledge, Tom and his wife are committed to using their resources to advance technology access, education, and climate resilience. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Tom continues to mentor founders and engineers, championing ideas that reimagine what's possible at the intersection of software, AI, and humanity.

Ideas start with founders. Founders start with PWV.
